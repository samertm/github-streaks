# Ideas

 - start with the fun part
 - get two people, show their commit streaks
 - what am I tracking? what do I need? how many people have a commit streak?
 - find a web framework

# Usage

```
 $ racket main.rkt serve    # Start the server.
 $ racket main.rkt db-reset # Reset the database.
 $ racket main.rkt help     # Show help.
```
